#

#
* Note that some flags have overlap and may be duplicated with other metadata support. Most notably this happens with [[metadata_linux_attrib|Linux EXT2 file attributes]].
#
* Archival of flags is implemented using the <tt>st_flags</tt> struct member of the [[metadata_stat|stat metadata]] on platforms that support it.
#
* Extraction of flags is implemented using the chflags(2) APIs on platforms that support it.
